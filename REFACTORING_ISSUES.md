# Refactoring Regression Issues - 2025-08-07

## üö® Known Issues After Store Refactoring

### **Critical Functionality Breaks**

1. **Cell Highlighting Not Working**
   - Issue: Bingo squares don't visually highlight when clicked
   - Likely cause: State updates not triggering UI re-renders
   - Impact: High - core gameplay broken

2. **Room Player Count Incorrect**
   - Issue: Multiplayer rooms not showing accurate player counts
   - Likely cause: Connection/room state sync issues between stores
   - Impact: High - multiplayer functionality compromised

3. **General Multiplayer State Issues**
   - Issue: Room state synchronization problems
   - Likely cause: Store separation broke cross-store dependencies
   - Impact: High - multiplayer features unreliable

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

The store refactoring successfully compiled and built, but introduced runtime issues where:
- State updates aren't propagating correctly between modules
- React re-renders aren't triggered when game state changes
- Store dependencies and subscriptions may be broken

## üìã Action Items for Tomorrow

### **Immediate Priority**
1. Fix cell highlighting in solo play mode
2. Restore room player count accuracy
3. Test and fix multiplayer synchronization

### **Investigation Points**
- Check if Zustand subscriptions are working between stores
- Verify React component re-renders on state changes
- Test WebSocket message handling and state updates
- Validate compatibility layer in store.ts

### **Testing Checklist**
- [ ] Solo play: Square marking and visual feedback
- [ ] Solo play: Win detection and highlighting
- [ ] Multiplayer: Room creation and joining
- [ ] Multiplayer: Player count accuracy
- [ ] Multiplayer: Real-time square synchronization
- [ ] Multiplayer: WebSocket/polling fallback

## üìä Refactoring Success vs Issues

### ‚úÖ Successful
- Code compiled without errors
- Architecture simplified (4 focused stores)
- 32 lines removed from App.tsx
- Configuration consolidated
- Build process working

### ‚ùå Regressions
- Cell interaction broken
- Multiplayer state sync broken
- Runtime functionality compromised

## üéØ Tomorrow's Strategy

1. **Quick Fix**: Identify and resolve critical state subscription issues
2. **Test**: Systematic testing of all core functionality
3. **Validate**: Ensure both solo and multiplayer modes work correctly
4. **Document**: Update with lessons learned
