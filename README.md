# Jargon

Buzzword bingo you play during real work meetings. Open the app, get a card of corporate buzzwords, and tap them as you hear them. Complete a line and you win.

## How It Works

**Solo** — Play during any meeting. Random card, tap buzzwords as they come up, track your score across games.

**Duo** — Pair with a colleague in the same meeting. You both get the same daily card (Wordle-style, one per day). Each secretly picks a line to complete. Race to finish yours first.

Works best on your phone during meetings. No app install needed — it's a PWA.
