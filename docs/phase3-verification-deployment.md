# Phase 3: Democratic Verification System - Deployment Summary

**Deployment Date**: January 2025
**Status**: ✅ LIVE IN PRODUCTION
**Backend Version**: 89807ad4-c103-4bc1-a528-49ba0e6f9bbf
**Commit**: 7d59d92

## Overview

Phase 3 implements a democratic verification system for multiplayer square claims. Players must receive majority approval (>50%) from other players before a square is marked and points are awarded.

## Architecture

### Backend Changes (worker.js)

**New State Management**:
```javascript
this.pendingVerifications = new Map(); // verificationId -> verification object
```

**New Handlers**:
1. `request_verification` - Creates verification request and broadcasts to all players except claimer
2. `cast_vote` - Records player votes and triggers resolution when all votes received
3. `resolveVerification` - Majority voting logic with auto-approval for missing votes

**Key Features**:
- Player exclusion in broadcasts (claiming player doesn't vote on own claim)
- 30-second timeout with auto-approval
- Majority rule: >50% approval required
- Missing votes count as approval (benefit of doubt)
- No penalty for rejection

### Frontend Changes

**New Store** (`src/stores/verificationStore.ts`):
- Manages verification state and vote tracking
- Handles modal visibility and user voting status
- Auto-cleanup of expired verifications

**New Component** (`src/components/bingo/VerificationModal.tsx`):
- Centered modal with blurred backdrop
- 30-second countdown timer with progress bar
- Approve/Reject buttons
- Auto-approve on timeout
- Toast notification on vote submission

**Updated Components**:
- `connectionStore.ts`: Added `verification_request` and `verification_resolved` message handlers
- `App.tsx`: Modified `handleSquareClick` to request verification in multiplayer, bypass in solo

## Game Flow

### Multiplayer Mode (2+ players in room)

1. **Player clicks square**:
   - Sends `request_verification` with squareIndex and buzzword
   - Shows toast: "Verification Requested"
   - Square does NOT mark yet

2. **Other players receive modal**:
   - Modal displays claiming player name and buzzword
   - 30-second countdown begins
   - Players can vote Approve/Reject or wait for timeout

3. **Vote resolution**:
   - **Majority Approve**: Square marks, points awarded (1 + bonuses)
   - **Majority Reject**: No marking, no points, no penalty
   - **Timeout**: Auto-approves (benefit of doubt)
   - Toast shows result to all players

4. **Bonus calculation**:
   - 3-in-a-row: +1 bonus
   - 4-in-a-row: +3 bonus
   - BINGO: +5 bonus
   - Anti-stacking: Map-based tracking prevents duplicate bonuses

### Solo Mode

- Verification bypassed entirely
- Instant marking on click (original behavior)
- Points awarded immediately

## Deployment Verification

**Backend**:
```bash
curl https://corporate-bingo-api.ryanwixon15.workers.dev/health
# Should return: {"status":"healthy","timestamp":"..."}
```

**Frontend**:
```bash
curl -s https://corporate-bingo-ai.netlify.app/assets/index-*.js | grep -c "cast_vote"
# Should return: 1 (verification code present)
```

## Testing Checklist

### Functional Tests

- [ ] **Create Room**: 3+ players join same room
- [ ] **Request Verification**: Player clicks square, modal appears for others
- [ ] **Vote Approve**: Majority votes yes, square marks and points awarded
- [ ] **Vote Reject**: Majority votes no, square doesn't mark
- [ ] **Timeout Auto-Approve**: Wait 30 seconds, square auto-marks
- [ ] **Solo Bypass**: Solo player clicks square, marks instantly
- [ ] **Multiple Requests**: Queue multiple verifications, handle correctly
- [ ] **Disconnect During Vote**: Player disconnects, missing vote counts as approve

### Edge Cases

- [ ] **Claimer Disconnects**: Verification resolves automatically
- [ ] **All Players Vote Early**: Resolves before 30-second timeout
- [ ] **Simultaneous Claims**: Multiple verification modals queue properly
- [ ] **Network Issues**: WebSocket fallback to polling works
- [ ] **Bonus Stacking**: Map-based tracking prevents duplicate bonuses

### Performance Tests

- [ ] **Response Time**: Verification request → modal display < 200ms
- [ ] **Vote Latency**: Vote submission → resolution < 500ms
- [ ] **Memory Leaks**: No lingering verifications after expiration
- [ ] **Concurrent Rooms**: Multiple rooms handle verifications independently

## Known Limitations

1. **No Vote History**: Previous votes not displayed to players
2. **No Vote Breakdown**: Players don't see who voted what (privacy by design)
3. **No Vote Retraction**: Once voted, cannot change vote
4. **No Spectator Mode**: All room members must vote or wait for timeout

## Next Steps

- **Phase 4**: Room-wide board reset after BINGO (sync all players)
- **Phase 5**: Real-time score synchronization fixes
- **Phase 6**: Comprehensive end-to-end testing

## Technical Debt

- Dynamic imports cause Vite warnings (not critical, works as expected)
- connectionStore and verificationStore circular dependency (resolved via async import)
- Missing TypeScript interfaces for vote breakdown (typed inline)

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:
```bash
# Revert backend
cd "F:/CC/Projects/Corporate Bingo"
git checkout 703d26a  # Previous working commit
npx wrangler deploy

# Revert frontend
git push origin 703d26a:main --force
# Wait for Netlify rebuild
```
