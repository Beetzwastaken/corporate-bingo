# Phase 4: Room-Wide Board Reset After BINGO - Deployment Summary

**Deployment Date**: January 2025
**Status**: ✅ LIVE IN PRODUCTION
**Backend Version**: 50c9de48-bf2f-46bf-9bb9-9875d025e763
**Frontend Bundle**: index-BANzDmJP.js
**Commit**: 167f7eb

## Overview

Phase 4 implements automatic room-wide board reset after a player achieves BINGO. All players receive fresh boards simultaneously after a 3-second countdown, while maintaining their cumulative scores across rounds.

## Implementation Summary

### Backend Changes (worker.js)

**New Method: `resetRoomBoards()`** (lines 937-955)
```javascript
async resetRoomBoards(winnerPlayer) {
  // Clear all players' marked squares
  for (const player of this.room.players) {
    player.markedSquares.clear();
    // Scores are preserved (not modified)
  }

  // Broadcast reset to all players
  this.broadcastToRoom({
    type: 'board_reset',
    winner: { id: winnerPlayer.id, name: winnerPlayer.name },
    finalScore: winnerPlayer.score,
    timestamp: Date.now()
  });

  // Save updated room state
  await this.state.storage.put('room', this.room);
}
```

**Trigger Points**:
- After `player_won` broadcast (line 567-569): 3-second delay
- After verification-approved BINGO (line 917-920): 3-second delay

The 3-second delay ensures the winner sees their BINGO modal before the board resets.

### Frontend Changes

**1. connectionStore.ts** (lines 399-416)
Added `board_reset` message handler:
- Receives winner info and final score
- Shows toast notification with winner name and score
- Calls `gameStore.resetBoard()` to clear board while preserving score

**2. gameStore.ts** (lines 34, 175-179)
Added `resetBoard()` method:
- Calls `initializeGame()` to generate new board
- Clears `markedSquares` and `appliedBonuses`
- Automatically preserves `currentScore` (not reset by `initializeGame`)

**3. BingoModal.tsx** (lines 10-31, 67-72)
Enhanced with countdown timer:
- 3-second countdown state
- Auto-close after countdown completes
- Visual countdown display: "New round in 3... 2... 1..."
- Skip button: "Click anywhere to skip"

## Game Flow

### Multiplayer Mode (2+ players)

1. **Player achieves BINGO**:
   - `player_won` message broadcast to all players
   - Winner sees BINGO modal with countdown
   - Backend waits 3 seconds

2. **Board reset broadcast**:
   - All players receive `board_reset` message
   - Winner info and final score included
   - Toast notification shows: "[Winner] Won! Scored [X] points. New round starting..."

3. **Client-side reset**:
   - Each player's `gameStore.resetBoard()` called
   - New boards generated independently
   - Scores preserved across reset
   - Modal auto-closes after countdown

### Solo Mode

- No change to existing behavior
- Winner sees modal with countdown
- Manual "Get New Board" button still functional
- Score persists through BINGOs

## Key Features

- ✅ **Synchronized Reset**: All players get new boards simultaneously
- ✅ **Score Persistence**: Cumulative scores maintained across rounds
- ✅ **Winner Recognition**: Toast notification shows winner and final score
- ✅ **3-Second Countdown**: Visual feedback before reset
- ✅ **Skip Option**: Players can click to skip countdown
- ✅ **Solo Mode Unaffected**: Existing solo gameplay preserved

## Testing Checklist

### Functional Tests
- [ ] **3+ Player Room**: All players receive new boards after BINGO
- [ ] **Score Persistence**: Winner's score maintained through reset
- [ ] **Countdown Timer**: 3-second countdown displays correctly
- [ ] **Toast Notification**: Shows winner name and final score
- [ ] **Skip Functionality**: Clicking modal skips countdown
- [ ] **Solo Mode**: No room reset, existing behavior intact

### Edge Cases
- [ ] **Player Disconnects**: Room continues with remaining players
- [ ] **Multiple Simultaneous BINGOs**: First detected triggers reset
- [ ] **Rapid Consecutive BINGOs**: Countdown doesn't stack
- [ ] **2-Player Room**: Both players get fresh boards

### Performance
- [ ] **Reset Latency**: < 500ms after 3-second delay
- [ ] **WebSocket Efficiency**: Broadcast performance with 10+ players
- [ ] **No Memory Leaks**: Repeated resets don't accumulate state

## Deployment Verification

### Backend Health Check
```bash
curl https://corporate-bingo-api.ryanwixon15.workers.dev/health
# Expected: {"status":"healthy","timestamp":"..."}
```

### Frontend Code Presence
```bash
curl -s https://corporate-bingo-ai.netlify.app/assets/index-BANzDmJP.js | grep -c "board_reset"
# Expected: 1

curl -s https://corporate-bingo-ai.netlify.app/assets/index-BANzDmJP.js | grep -c "New round in"
# Expected: 1
```

**Verification Result**: ✅ Both checks passed

## Known Limitations

1. **No Individual Opt-Out**: All players in room reset together
2. **Fixed 3-Second Delay**: Not configurable per room
3. **No Board State Sync**: Players generate new boards independently (intended behavior)
4. **No Reset Animation**: Instant board replacement (could add fade transition)

## Technical Notes

### Type Safety
- Added type casting for `message.winner` in connectionStore: `const winner = message.winner as { id: string; name: string }`
- Ensures TypeScript compilation with strict mode

### Dynamic Imports
- Vite warnings about dynamic imports are informational only
- No impact on functionality or performance

### Countdown Implementation
- Uses `setInterval` with `useState` for countdown
- Auto-cleans up interval on unmount
- Triggers `onBingo` callback after countdown completes

## Next Steps

- **Phase 5**: Real-time score synchronization improvements
- **Phase 6**: Comprehensive end-to-end testing with 10+ players
- **Future Enhancement**: Configurable countdown duration per room type

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:
```bash
cd "F:/CC/Projects/Corporate Bingo"
git revert 167f7eb
git push origin main
npx wrangler deploy
# Wait for Netlify rebuild
```
