# 🚀 EngineerMemes.AI - Netlify Deployment Options

## Option 1: Quick Manual Deploy (2 minutes)
For immediate testing - but you'd need to re-upload for each change.

## Option 2: Automatic Git Deploy (5 minutes setup, then automatic forever!)
**RECOMMENDED** - Same setup as your SPAIRO and web-showcase projects.
See `GITHUB_SETUP.md` for automatic deployment instructions.

## Option 1: Quick Manual Deployment

### Method 1: Netlify Drag & Drop (Recommended)

1. **Go to Netlify**
   - Visit: https://app.netlify.com/
   - Log into your existing Netlify account

2. **Deploy Your App**
   - Look for "Want to deploy a new site without connecting to Git?"
   - Click "Browse to upload" 
   - **Select the entire `F:/CC/Projects/engineer-memes/dist/` folder**
   - Drag and drop or browse to upload

3. **Get Your URL**
   - Netlify will assign a random URL like `https://amazing-engineer-12345.netlify.app`
   - **This is your shareable URL for friends!**

4. **Customize (Optional)**
   - Click "Site settings" → "Change site name"
   - Change to: `engineer-memes-ai` 
   - Your URL becomes: `https://engineer-memes-ai.netlify.app`

### Method 2: Git Integration (If CLI works later)
