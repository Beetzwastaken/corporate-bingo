## Game Modes

### Solo
- Random card, mark squares during any meeting, track score
- Pure client-side, no backend needed
- **Status**: Needs building (gameStore.ts exists but disconnected)

### Duo
- 2 players pair up in same meeting, share daily card
- Each secretly picks a line (row/col/diagonal), race to complete
- WebSocket sync with HTTP polling fallback
- **Status**: Built, needs end-to-end testing

### Duo Flow
1. **Unpaired** → Enter name, create room OR join with 4-char code
2. **Waiting** → Host shares code with partner
3. **Selecting** → Both secretly pick a line
4. **Playing** → Same card, mark squares as you hear them, race to BINGO

### Daily Card
- Seeded PRNG (Mulberry32) + Fisher-Yates shuffle
- Same date → same 25 phrases globally
- Resets at midnight user timezone

## Architecture

### Stores (Zustand + persist)

| Store | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `duoStore` | Pairing, lines, scores, game state |
| `connectionStore` | WebSocket/polling, routes messages |
| `uiStore` | Modals, sidebar |
| `gameStore` | Solo mode (disconnected, needs re-wire) |

### Backend (worker.js)

Cloudflare Worker + Durable Objects. Duo API:
```
POST /api/duo/create, /join, /:code/select, /:code/mark, /:code/leave
GET  /api/duo/:code/state, /:code/ws
```

WebSocket messages: `connected`, `partner_joined`, `partner_left`, `partner_selected`, `line_conflict`, `card_revealed`, `square_marked`, `bingo`, `daily_reset`
